      Material UI - Overview Material UI is an open-source React component
      library that implements Google's Material Design. It's comprehensive and
      can be used in production out of the box. Introduction Material UI is an
      open-source React component library that implements Google's Material
      Design. It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that
      are ready for use in production right out of the box. Material UI is
      beautiful by design and features a suite of customization options that
      make it easy to implement your own custom design system on top of our
      components. Material UI v5 supports Material Design v2. Adoption of v3 is
      tentatively planned for Material UI v6—see the release schedule. You can
      follow this GitHub issue for future updates. Advantages of Material UI
      Ship faster: Over 2,500 open-source contributors have poured countless
      hours into these components. Focus on your core business logic instead of
      reinventing the wheel—we've got your UI covered. Beautiful by default:
      We're meticulous about our implementation of Material Design, ensuring
      that every Material UI component meets the highest standards of form and
      function, but diverge from the official spec where necessary to provide
      multiple great options. Customizability: The library includes an extensive
      set of intuitive customizability features. The templates in our store
      demonstrate how far you can go with customization. Cross-team
      collaboration: Material UI's intuitive developer experience reduces the
      barrier to entry for back-end developers and less technical designers,
      empowering teams to collaborate more effectively. The design kits
      streamline your workflow and boost consistency between designers and
      developers. Trusted by thousands of organizations: Material UI has the
      largest UI community in the React ecosystem. It's almost as old as React
      itself—its history stretches back to 2014—and we're in this for the long
      haul. You can count on the community's support for years to come (e.g.
      Stack Overflow). Material UI vs. Base UI Material UI and Base UI feature
      many of the same UI components, but Base UI comes without any default
      styles or styling solutions. Material UI is comprehensive in that it comes
      packaged with default styles, and is optimized to work with Emotion (or
      styled-components). Base UI, by contrast, could be considered the
      "skeletal" or "headless" counterpart to Material UI—in fact, future
      versions of Material UI will use Base UI components and hooks for its
      foundational structure.
